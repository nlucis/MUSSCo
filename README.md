unga-bunga use flow: record sound of awk-awk. record many sound of awk-awk. these called awk-awk-samples. 
awk-awk-samples layered and edited via simple p5.sound filter modules and simple visual interface modules to accompany them.
samples then used raw or fed to ML5 machine learning module to extract and synthesize a replica of the desired sample.

This sample is then used or layered as part of a "phonemic structure", which can be used to represent a word, complex sound, etc.
Various modules with set processes for their input and output can be employed and connected together to filter and isolate the desired
vocalization.

These extracted vocalizations or sounds can then be assigned a simple (-) Glyph which can then be placed on a scrubbable circular playback timeline.
